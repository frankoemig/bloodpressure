Different protocols are used in conjunction with blood pressure measurements.
Therefore, the information models should cover all aspects that are needed to specify what to measure exactly.

| Protocol | Description | aspects to consider |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PO standard | normal observation by a physician in his office | normally performed in office, patient is sitting and in rest, professional device, measured at arm |
| home measurement | self-observation of patient | performed at home, with untrusted device, typically measured at wrist |
| AOBP | Automated Office Blood Pressure | measuring blood pressure in a clinical setting that uses an automated device to take multiple readings with the patient alone in a room, thereby eliminating the "white coat effect" and human error associated with manual measurements |
| Bruce | Bruce treadmilll test | evaluation of cardiac function and physical fitness
| Naughton | treadmill protocol | increasing exertion |
| [NHANES](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/public/2021/manuals/2021-BloodPressureProcedures-508.pdf) | National Health and Nutrititon Examination Survey |
| orthostatic | supine -> sitting -> standing | varying body position to examine what happens if patient stands up |
| 24h average | sequence of observations during 24 hours | measured all 15 minutes for 24 hours, at arm, arbitrary exertion, activity unclear |
| tilt | sequence of measurements with increasing tilt | tilt angle |
| .. | .. |

The aspects will be further specified...

* *Systolic (Blood) Pressure Intervention Trial* (SPRINT):  clinical trial that found that treating high blood pressure (hypertension) to a lower goal of less than 120 mm Hg significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular events and death compared to standard treatment (less than 140 mm Hg) in high-risk patients
