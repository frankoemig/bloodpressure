#### Step 4b: Template (with CDA)

Unfortunately, PlantUML does not allow for drawing the classes as it has been done with Visio.
Therefore, it has been adopted and colorized as closely as possible.

<div width="500px">
{% include bloodpressure_cda.svg %}
</div>

Notes:

* Not all entries are added into this drawing.
