This page should collect the details for the content itself. 
However, as this guide is at the moment not mature enough, and the necessary resources are not yet provided
this page is in a very draft state:

| Element | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| systolic | 
| diastolic |
| exertion |
| pulse pressure |
| mean arterial pressure | as a calculated information |
| spot measurement | 
| average value | calculated value, optionally with references to the individual measurements |
| recorded date time |
| date/time of observation |
| comment |
| ... |

### Open Issues

* collect all details
* introduce hierarchic structure (to visualize dependencies)
