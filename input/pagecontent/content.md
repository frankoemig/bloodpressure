This page should collect the details for the content itself. 
However, as this guide is at the moment not mature enough, and the necessary resources are not yet provided
this page is in a very draft state. It can be expected to enhance it at later point in time:

| Element | Explanation / Comment |
| --- | --- |
| systolic | component |
| diastolic | component |
| exertion | level of physical exercising, including the indication of performed exercises shortly before the measurement |
| pulse pressure |
| normal non-invasive measurements | this is a set of 'simple' non-invasive measurements that are usually done by either the physician or the patient |
| special non-invasive measurements | another set of non-invasive measurements are only performed by surgeons |
| special invasive measurements | special bp measurement that require a surgery |
| mean arterial pressure | calculation by integratoing a set of individual measurements |
| pulse pressure | calculated value out of systolic and diastolic values |
| spot measurement | to be included in average calculations |
| average value | calculated value, optionally with references to the individual measurements; <br/> some average values are treated as a single spot value because the source values appear over a short period of time |
| date time of recording|
| date/time of observation |
| involved actors | who is involved into measuring bp values: physician, patient, recorder, .. |
| relevant medication |
| comment |
