this page is in a very draft state. It can be expected to enhance it at later point in time:

| Element | Explanation / Comment |
| --- | --- |
| systolic | component |
| diastolic | component |
| exertion | level of physical exercising, including the indication of performed exercises shortly before the measurement |
| pulse pressure |
| mean arterial pressure | as a calculated information |
| spot measurement | to be included in average calculations |
| average value | calculated value, optionally with references to the individual measurements |
| date time of recording|
| date/time of observation |
| involved actors |
| relevant medication |
| comment |
| ... |
