#### Step 4c: OBX Segment Group profile (with v2.x)

Please see [logical model](StructureDefinition-OBXbloodpressuresegmentgroup.html).

As a draft:

| Segment | Card. | Content | Value Type | Unit | Code | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PID | 1..1 | Patient information | n/a | n/a | n/a | PID-3 |
| PV1 | 1..1 | Visit information | n/a | n/a | n/a | PV1-19 |
| OBX | 1..1 | blood pressure |  NM | mmHg | $LOINC#85354-9 | main entry into BP results |
| PRT | 0..* | for different participants | n/a | n/a | n/a | appropriate participant definitions are necessary |
| OBX | 1..1 | systolic value | NM | mmHg |  $LOINC#8480-6 |
| OBX | 0..1 | diastolic value | NM | mmHg | $LOINC#8462-4 |
| OBX | 0..1 | mean arterial pressure | NM | mmHg | ? |
| OBX | 0..1 | pulse pressure  | NM | mmHg | ? |
| OBX | 0..1 | exertion | CWE | W | #exertion |
| OBX | 0..1 | location | CWE | n/a | #location |
| OBX | 0..1 | position | CWE | n/a | #position |
| OBX | 0..1 | sleeping status | CWE | n/a | #sleepingStatus |
| OBX | 0..1 | cuff type | CWE | n/a | #cuffType |
| OBX | 0..1 | cuff size | CWE | n/a | #cuffSize |
| OBX | 0..1 | anesthesia | CWE | n/a | #anesthesia |

Notes:

* It has to be considered that segments are relevant that are not directly represented in the same group.
* Some codes are just place holders.
